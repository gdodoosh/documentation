Flashing the SD card
====================

In some circumstances, the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box's Micro SD Card may need to be
re-flashed to benefit from Odoo's latest :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` image update. This means
that the Odoo :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box software may need to be updated.

Upgrade from the IoT box home page
==================================

Go to the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box homepage by navigating to :menuselection:`IoT app -->
IoT Boxes` and clicking on the :abbr:`IP (Internet Protocol)` address of the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of
Things)` box. Then click on :guilabel:`Update` (next to the version number).

If a new version of the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box image is available, an
:guilabel:`Upgrade to _xx.xx_` button will appear at the bottom of the page. Click this button to
upgrade the unit and the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box will then flash itself to the new
version. All of the previous configurations will be saved.

.. note::
   This process can take more than 30 minutes. Do not turn off or unplug the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of
   Things)` box as it would leave it in an inconsistent state. This means that the :abbr:`IoT
   (Internet of Things)` box will need to be re-flashed with a new image. See
   :ref:`iot/config/flash_sdcard_etcher`.

Upgrade with Etcher software
============================

.. note::
   A computer with a Micro SD card reader/adapter is required in order to re-flash the Micro SD
   card.

Navigate to Balena's website and download `Etcher <https://www.balena.io/>`_. It's a free and
open-source utility used for burning image files onto drives. Click to `download
<https://www.balena.io/etcher#download-etcher>`_. Install and launch the program on the computer.

Then download the version-specific :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` image from `nightly
<http://nightly.odoo.com/master/iotbox/>`_.

The following are image versions on the `nightly <http://nightly.odoo.com/master/iotbox/>`_ website
with their corresponding Odoo database version:

+------------------+---------------------------+
| Database Version | Image Version             |
+==================+===========================+
| Odoo 16          | :file:`iotbox-latest.zip` |
+------------------+---------------------------+
| Odoo V15         | :file:`iotboxv21_10.zip`  |
+------------------+---------------------------+
| Odoo V14         | :file:`iotboxv21_04.zip`  |
+------------------+---------------------------+
| Odoo V13         | :file:`iotboxv20_10.zip`  |
+------------------+---------------------------+

The images should be downloaded and extracted to a convenient file location.

After this step is complete, insert the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box's Micro SD card into
the computer or reader. Open *Etcher* and select :guilabel:`Flash from file`, then find and select
the image just downloaded and extracted. Next, select the drive the image should be burned to.
Lastly, click on :guilabel:`Flash` and wait for the process to finish.

   An alternative software for flashing the Micro SD card is *Raspberry Pi Imager*. Download the
   *Raspberry Pi* software `here <https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/>`_.
